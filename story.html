<h1> The story so far...</h1>

<p>Pont3 is a Sydney based event management company that specialises in major events, corporate events, brand experiences and sponsorship nationwide. </p>

<p>We work at a strategic level with clients to deliver major events or brand experience which reflect your values and the objectives of your message or campaign. We believe that a message is best received in an engaging environment to ensure your messages are seen and heard.</p>

<p>We have the capabilities to manage small to large scale events, from marketing, communication, public relations, social media, live broadcast production, sampling, publicity, venue management...</p>

<p>Wayne Larden is the CEO and founder of Pont3. Pont3 was established in 2005 to specifically undertake the management of the Sydney Running Festival in partnership with Athletics Australia, the event owner. Over the years Pont3 has managed an array of large format mass participation running or sporting events in various cities around Australia, including Melbourne.</p> 

<p>In just 10 short years the Sydney Running Festival has grown from 12,000 participants to over 32,000 in 2015. The event has grown to include four individual components all run on the same morning, starting in Bradfield Park, Milsons Point over the Harbour Bridge then on various routes around the CBD to the Opera House and Conservatorium of Music finish lines – simultaneously. The event now includes a full marathon, half marathon, 9k fun run and 3.5k fun run. It is broadcast live for 3hr30min around Australia and internationally into 180m households throughout Asia, including Japan and China. Pont3 jointly produces the broadcast.</p> 

<p>The Sydney Running Festival is a NSW Government “Hallmark Event” and receives significant investment from Destination NSW to assist with the international marketing of the event and ensure ongoing broadcast coverage. </p> 

<p>In 2015 the event was awarded the IAAF Marathon Gold Label, one of a very small number awarded each year by the international federation. </p> 

<p>Wayne Larden is responsible for key relationship management, overall event strategy, marketing, operations, risk management and delivery of all components of the event. The Sydney Running Festival has a significant sponsorship base from very large brands and is required to undertake all contract negotiations, management, implementation and activation of sponsor benefits throughout each term.</p> 

<p>Pont3 also owns and manages the Sydney Harbour 10k and 5k, a certified accurate spectacular course around the Sydney Harbour and CBD with over 6,000 participants in its fourth year. </p>
